# Design Patterns

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to common problems observed during software design development.

A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code.

It is a description or template for how to solve a problem in efficient manner, without having to re-invent the cycle again.

They can be classified under following heads:

1. Creational 
2. Structural
3. Behavioral

# Proxy Design pattern

Creational design patterns deals with object creation - where object creation is simplified for better access, polymorphic behavior, logging, caching

Proxy design pattern is creational as it helps:

1. create a proxy to original object - by extending it's logic
2. create a kind of wrapper around original object to control it's processing logic
