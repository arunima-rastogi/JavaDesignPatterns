Observer design pattern defines 1 to many dependencies between objects.  It establishes the relationship such that if any one object changes it updates / all dependents.

Subject:  The object which is being watched.
Observer: The object whichare watched.

Observer design pattern follows "Open Closed Principle" - a class should be open for extension without the need to change class.
